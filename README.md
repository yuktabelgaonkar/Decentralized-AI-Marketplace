AI ML Blockchain Platform


Overview

The AI ML Blockchain Platform is a decentralized application (DApp) that leverages blockchain technology and IPFS (InterPlanetary File System) for managing AI models and datasets. This platform enables users to develop, deploy, and monetize AI agents for various applications, particularly focusing on decentralized finance (DeFi) scenarios.


Features

AI Contract Interaction: Users can set and retrieve data using a smart contract deployed on the Ethereum blockchain.

Dataset Marketplace: A decentralized marketplace allows users to list, purchase, and sell datasets securely using blockchain technology.

IPFS Integration: IPFS is used for decentralized storage of AI models and datasets, ensuring data availability and resilience.

Web Interface: An intuitive web interface allows users to interact with the platform, upload datasets, and manage transactions.

Technologies Used

Blockchain: Ethereum blockchain for smart contract deployment and interaction.

IPFS: Decentralized storage solution for storing AI models and datasets.

Web3.js: JavaScript library for interacting with Ethereum smart contracts.

HTML/CSS: Frontend development for the web interface.

JavaScript (Node.js): Backend scripting for managing transactions and interactions.


Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

Clone the repository.

Install dependencies using npm install.

Deploy the smart contracts using tools like Remix or Hardhat.

Update the contract addresses and ABIs in app.js.

Run the frontend using a local server (npm start or similar).
